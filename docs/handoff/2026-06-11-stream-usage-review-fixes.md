# Stream Usage Review Fixes Handoff

## Context

This session implemented and reviewed streaming usage conversion/recording for Claude API -> OpenAI Chat Completions compatibility. The main acceptance spec is [docs/stream-usage-acceptance.md](../stream-usage-acceptance.md).

User preferences that matter for the next session:

- Address the user as `101同志`.
- Default to Chinese for communication.
- Follow project standards and `karpathy-guidelines` for coding work.
- Ask before committing; do not push unless explicitly requested.

## Current State

Working tree has uncommitted changes. Two new files are already staged so `git diff HEAD` includes them:

- [eslint.config.js](../../eslint.config.js)
- [src/converters/usage.ts](../../src/converters/usage.ts)

Other modified files remain unstaged. Check the exact state with:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff --cached --stat
```

Core behavior implemented:

- Streaming requests still use `stream_options.include_usage`.
- `message_start.message.usage` remains a Claude API compatibility placeholder and is not recorded as token usage.
- Final `message_delta.usage` maps OpenAI `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, and `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.
- Missing final usage chunk records `usageStatus: "missing_final_chunk"` and omits unknown token counts.
- Complete usage records use `usageStatus: "complete"`.
- Non-stream records now include `usageStatus: "complete"`.
- Cache usage is only emitted when upstream explicitly provides `cached_tokens`; explicit `0` is preserved.

Review-fix work completed:

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` `Unreleased` entries for usage, JSONL schema, and ESLint 9 config.
- Added review-checklist language in the acceptance doc distinguishing lint infrastructure from usage behavior.
- Added explicit return annotations to the new test iterator object methods.
- Ran Prettier over all changed files.
- Added ESLint 9 flat config to make the existing `npm run lint` command work.

## Verification Already Run

These commands passed after the review fixes:

```bash
npx prettier --check CHANGELOG.md docs/stream-usage-acceptance.md src/converters/streaming.ts src/server/handlers.ts src/server/index.ts src/utils/config.ts src/utils/metadata.ts src/utils/tokenUsage.ts src/utils/validation.ts tests/errorLog.test.ts tests/fileStorage.test.ts tests/handlers.test.ts tests/metadata.test.ts tests/streaming.test.ts tests/tokenUsage.test.ts eslint.config.js src/converters/usage.ts
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test -- --runTestsByPath tests/streaming.test.ts tests/response.test.ts tests/request.test.ts tests/tokenUsage.test.ts tests/handlers.test.ts --runInBand
npm test -- --runInBand
git diff --check
```

## Important Review Notes

Previous review findings were:

- `CHANGELOG.md` missing: fixed.
- Prettier failing: fixed.
- Test iterator methods lacked explicit return types: fixed.
- `src/converters/usage.ts` untracked: staged.
- Scope creep concern around lint infra: documented as separate atomic change, but still in the same working tree.

The large diff in many files is mostly Prettier normalization after adding `eslint.config.js`. If the next session needs cleaner commits, split into two commits:

1. Lint infrastructure and formatting cleanup.
2. Streaming usage behavior and tests.

## Suggested Skills

- `review`: rerun Standards/Spec review before committing.
- `git-commit`: create atomic commits if the user approves.
- `karpathy-guidelines`: keep any follow-up fixes surgical.
- `tdd`: use only if new behavior changes are requested.

## Next Actions

1. Rerun `[$review]` against current workspace vs `HEAD` if the user wants confirmation that findings are resolved.
2. If review is clean, ask `101同志` whether to create commits.
3. If committing, prefer two atomic commits as described above.
4. Do not push unless explicitly requested.
