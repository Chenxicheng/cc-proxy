# HTTP API Reference

cc-proxy is a CLI product. It starts a native Rust proxy and does not export Node.js server or converter APIs.

## `POST /v1/messages`

Accepts an Anthropic Messages request and forwards it to the configured OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint. The maximum request body is 32 MiB.

```typescript
{
  model: string;
  max_tokens: number;
  messages: Array<{
    role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system';
    content: string | ContentBlock[];
  }>;
  system?: string | ContentBlock[];
  temperature?: number;
  top_p?: number;
  stream?: boolean;
  stop_sequences?: string[];
  tools?: Tool[];
  tool_choice?: ToolChoice;
  thinking?: {
    type?: 'enabled' | 'disabled' | 'adaptive';
    budget_tokens?: number;
  };
  output_config?: {
    effort?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh' | 'max';
    format?: {
      type: 'json_schema';
      schema: Record<string, unknown>;
    };
  };
  cache_control?: { type: 'ephemeral'; ttl?: '5m' | '1h' } | null;
  metadata?: { user_id?: string | null };
}
```

Every response includes `x-request-id`.

Errors returned by this handler, including invalid JSON, validation failures and oversized bodies, are recorded in `error_logs/*.jsonl` with `requestId` and `error.type`. HTTP failures include `error.status`; errors emitted inside an already-started SSE response use `stream_error` without inventing a new HTTP status. The terminal prints an `[error]` summary without upstream error bodies. Validated stream completion prints `[completed]` before the final SSE events are emitted; this does not acknowledge client receipt. Usage records include `requestId` for correlation. See [terminal controls](terminal.md).

Request conversion retains the established text/tool Chat Completions behavior where it matches the documented contracts. Input `user`, `assistant`, and text-only `system` messages retain their roles and order; top-level `system` is prepended. Unsupported roles, system-message `clear_at` values other than `never`, per-message `output_config`, and unsupported result-bearing content blocks return `400` instead of changing semantics or disappearing. Historical `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks keep the existing behavior described below. Messages with missing or null content are skipped; historical assistant text, including short replies and JSON-start text, is preserved. GPT-5 and OpenAI o-series models use `max_completion_tokens`; other models use `max_tokens`, with the existing Azure minimum adjustment.

Upstream requests explicitly send `Accept: application/json`, `Content-Type: application/json`, bearer authorization, `stream: true | false`, and an OpenAI JavaScript SDK-compatible user agent.

For Qwen3 models with `thinking.type` set to `enabled` or `adaptive`, a non-streaming client request uses `stream: true`, `stream_options.include_usage: true`, and the Qwen-specific `enable_thinking: true` extension upstream. The adapter validates and collects that SSE response before returning one Anthropic Messages JSON object; incomplete or invalid streams return an HTTP error without a partial success response. A client streaming request remains SSE. Explicit `thinking.type: disabled` sends `enable_thinking: false` without changing `stream`, while an absent `thinking` field does not add `enable_thinking`. Other models keep the client's upstream stream mode. Usage and error records describe the client-facing mode.

Client tools map only `name`, `description`, and `input_schema`; `strict: true` returns `400` because this path does not rewrite schemas to satisfy Chat's strict subset. `tools` and `stop_sequences` must be arrays, and every stop sequence must be a string; malformed values return `400` instead of being omitted. Tool choices map as `auto → auto`, `any → required`, `none → none`, and named `tool → function`; unsupported choices and named choices without a matching declared tool return `400`. An explicit `tool_choice.disable_parallel_tool_use` maps to the inverse Chat `parallel_tool_calls` value. Tool-result text becomes `role=tool` messages in input order, and every `tool_result.tool_use_id` must resolve to a preceding assistant `tool_use` in the same request.

For GPT-5 and OpenAI o-series models, `output_config.effort` and Anthropic thinking budgets map to the same `reasoning_effort` values as the TypeScript converter. GLM/Qwen retain their provider-specific options and tool-turn `reasoning_content`. Model-family detection uses the final provider-path segment, so `qwen3...` and `qwen/qwen3...` have identical Qwen behavior without matching unrelated model names. Other historical thinking is not forwarded; a thinking-only historical turn becomes an assistant message with null content. Explicit `output_config.format`, `top_k`, `service_tier`, `mcp_servers`, and `container` return `400` because this Chat path does not preserve their semantics. `cache_control` and `metadata.user_id` are ignored as hints or operational metadata; neither is forwarded. Stop arrays, including empty arrays, are forwarded as `stop`.

Anthropic defines a final assistant message as a response prefill, but standard OpenAI Chat Completions defines assistant input as prior model output and has no portable continuation flag. The adapter applies the configured prefill capability only to the final assistant message; earlier assistant messages remain history even when their text is short or begins JSON. An upstream that cannot continue a final assistant message may return a legal empty completion in a configured `native` mode. The real E2E probe records `terminalAssistantPrefill` so this capability mismatch is distinguishable from lost SSE data.

### Images

User image blocks map to Chat `image_url` parts in their original text/image order. HTTP(S) URLs pass through without a download; base64 JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP data becomes `data:<media_type>;base64,<data>`. Invalid and unsupported sources, including `file_id`, return `400`. The upstream model must support image input.

Chat tool messages support text only. When a `tool_result` contains images, its text remains in the tool message with an image pointer; a following user multimodal message contains the images in order, each preceded by its resolved `tool_call_id`. This intentionally changes the image's message role and is an adapter policy, not lossless protocol equivalence.

### Non-streaming response

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  type: 'message';
  role: 'assistant';
  content: ContentBlock[];
  model: string;
  stop_reason: 'end_turn' | 'max_tokens' | 'tool_use' | 'refusal';
  stop_details?: { type: 'refusal'; category: null; explanation: string };
  stop_sequence: null;
  usage: {
    input_tokens: number;
    output_tokens: number;
    cache_read_input_tokens?: number;
    cache_creation_input_tokens?: number;
  };
}
```

Finish reasons map as `stop → end_turn`, `length → max_tokens`, `tool_calls → tool_use`, and `content_filter → refusal`. A `length` response may retain complete tool calls as `tool_use` blocks. A refusal remains a normal text content block and includes `stop_details`. Unknown or legacy `function_call` finish reasons, undeclared or missing tool names, tool arguments that are not a complete JSON object, audio, and non-empty annotations are upstream protocol errors (`502`) in both JSON and SSE paths. The adapter cannot distinguish a natural OpenAI `stop` from a custom stop-sequence match, so `stop_sequence` remains `null`.

An upstream `stop` with no text, reasoning, refusal, or tool call is represented as the legal Anthropic shape `content: []` with `stop_reason: end_turn`. The adapter records this as `outcome: empty_end_turn` instead of changing it into an API error. Application acceptance tests may still fail such a response when the requested task required text or a tool call; protocol validity and task success are separate decisions.

### Streaming response

Streaming uses SSE and preserves Anthropic event order:

- `message_start`
- `content_block_start`
- `content_block_delta`
- `content_block_stop`
- `message_delta`
- `message_stop`

`message_start.message.usage` uses numeric zero placeholders. JSON and final `message_delta` usage share one conversion: `input_tokens = prompt_tokens - cached_tokens - cache_write_tokens`, `output_tokens = completion_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens = cached_tokens`, and `cache_creation_input_tokens = cache_write_tokens`. Token counts are unadjusted counts, and output does not subtract reasoning tokens.

When one cache detail is missing or null, the adapter subtracts and emits only the known cache count; `input_tokens` carries the remaining unclassified prompt balance, so it is not guaranteed to mean uncached input. When usage is absent, both required counters are zero placeholders and the usage record marks it `unreported`. Invalid totals, invalid cache details, or cache details exceeding `prompt_tokens` do not discard the answer: legal totals are retained, cache splitting is abandoned, and the record is marked `invalid` with the raw upstream usage. Complete and partially classified snapshots are recorded as `complete` and `incomplete`; incomplete records list the missing cache fields. These degraded counters are not suitable for exact billing. Streaming usage is a final cumulative snapshot and replaces earlier snapshots instead of being added.

Upstream `reasoning_content || reasoning` becomes `thinking` / `thinking_delta`, including reasoning-only completions and reasoning emitted after a tool call. A later tool-argument fragment remains attached to its original tool block. No cryptographic `signature` is fabricated. This preserves the established Claude Code display behavior; the unsigned block is not guaranteed to be replayable as native Anthropic signed thinking history. Reasoning text is not written to usage/error logs.

Every content block receives a consecutive, unique index; deltas for parallel tools route by their upstream index, regardless of arrival order. Text after tools is streamed immediately in a new block. Each block stops exactly once. Tool names are accumulated against the request's declared names: an exact match with no longer matching name starts immediately. Ambiguous names wait only for that tool until finish_reason or [DONE]. Repeating the same complete name after a tool block starts leaves its identity unchanged; a different name fails. Missing IDs are generated at block start; unknown final names fail. Arguments are streamed unchanged, then validated as a complete JSON object before block closure; absent arguments mean `{}`.

At finish_reason, content blocks close while the adapter continues reading final usage. `[DONE]`, or clean EOF following finish_reason, emits exactly one final message_delta/message_stop. An explicit `[DONE]` without finish_reason can infer end_turn/tool_use only for complete content. EOF without either terminal signal, malformed arguments, and transport errors emit `error` without successful final events. Empty choices, usage-only chunks, and content-free choice tails with no or the same finish_reason are accepted. New content or a conflicting finish_reason after finish_reason is an error.

A streamed `stop` with no content blocks likewise completes with the normal `message_delta(stop_reason=end_turn)` and `message_stop` sequence and is logged as `empty_end_turn`. Zero-byte bodies, malformed JSON/SSE, missing required structures, damaged tool arguments, and streams without a legal terminal signal remain protocol errors. Usage-only chunks update counters only and never create content or a second completion.

Streaming waits at four fixed boundaries: upstream response headers for 120 seconds, the first non-empty body bytes for 120 seconds after headers, the first emitted Anthropic event for 240 seconds after the same headers, and each later non-empty body chunk for 300 seconds while the downstream is polling. Header timeout returns an HTTP `504` error envelope. Once downstream SSE has started, timeout emits one `api_error` event and closes without `message_delta` or `message_stop`. Partial bytes, SSE comments, pings and empty frames do not satisfy the first Anthropic event deadline. The adapter does not pre-read or replay the first chunk, retry the POST, or synthesize heartbeats.

Parity exceptions: main's reused tool/text indices, fragmented tool names, missing block stops, and streaming `length` mapping are corrected. Existing explicit refusal handling and validation of malformed upstream payloads remain. Unknown finish reasons are errors. SSE framing uses eventsource-stream 0.2.3; output uses Axum Sse/Event, with demand-driven streaming and cancellation rather than automatic POST replay.

## `GET /health`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "adapter": "cc-proxy",
  "dropped_jsonl_records": 0
}
```

The dropped counter increases when the bounded observability queue cannot accept another JSONL record. Proxy traffic is not blocked by observability writes.

## Errors

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "Description of the error"
  }
}
```

| Status   | Error type              |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| 400, 413 | `invalid_request_error` |
| 401      | `authentication_error`  |
| 403      | `permission_error`      |
| 404      | `not_found_error`       |
| 429      | `rate_limit_error`      |
| 500+     | `api_error`             |

## Configuration

For a new installation, configuration and update metadata are stored in `~/.cc-proxy/`.
If `~/.claude-adapter/` already exists, cc-proxy continues to use that directory without moving it,
so the existing configuration remains compatible:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "apiKey": "...",
  "upstreamCapabilities": {
    "assistantPrefill": "unsupported"
  },
  "models": {
    "opus": "gpt-4.1",
    "sonnet": "gpt-4.1",
    "haiku": "gpt-4.1-mini"
  },
  "upstreamHeaders": {
    "HTTP-Referer": "https://example.com",
    "User-Agent": "cc-proxy/2.0"
  }
}
```

To keep the secret out of `config.json`, configure only its environment variable name:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "apiKeyEnv": "OPENAI_API_KEY",
  "upstreamCapabilities": {
    "assistantPrefill": "unsupported"
  },
  "models": {
    "opus": "gpt-4.1",
    "sonnet": "gpt-4.1",
    "haiku": "gpt-4.1-mini"
  }
}
```

Exactly one of `apiKey` and `apiKeyEnv` is required. Environment variable names must match
`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`; the variable must exist and be non-empty when the wizard runs and whenever
the adapter starts. The resolved value is never written back to configuration or logs.

`upstreamCapabilities.assistantPrefill` accepts exactly three values:

| Value | Request behavior |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| `unsupported` | Default. Reject a terminal Anthropic assistant prefill with `400 invalid_request_error` before contacting the upstream. |
| `continue_final_message` | Preserve the terminal assistant message and add `continue_final_message: true`. |
| `native` | Preserve the terminal assistant message without adding an extension. |

This setting describes the upstream API contract, not a model family. The adapter never infers it
from `baseUrl`, a provider name, or a model identifier. Existing configurations that omit the field
remain valid and use `unsupported`.

Configured upstream headers are forwarded unchanged. `Authorization`, `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Host` remain adapter-controlled and cannot be configured through the CLI.

The CLI selects a native binary, waits for its ready record, and then updates Claude settings. The proxy chooses the requested port or the next available port atomically.
