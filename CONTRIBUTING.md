## Making Changes

### Project Structure

```
claude-adapter/
├── native/                 # Rust proxy, protocol conversion, streaming, JSONL
├── src/
│   ├── cli.ts              # CLI/configuration entry point
│   └── native.ts           # Embedded binary selection and process lifecycle
├── tests/                  # Node CLI tests
├── bench/                  # Deterministic parity/performance harness
├── scripts/                # Offline release packaging
└── package.json
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Run in development mode**

   ```bash
   npm run build:native
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run tests continuously**

   ```bash
   npm test -- --watch
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

---

## Testing

All changes must include appropriate tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run native tests
npm run test:native

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/native.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Place Rust unit tests next to their implementation in `native/src/`
- Name test files with `.test.ts` suffix
- Follow existing test patterns and conventions

---

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you're changing functionality
2. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes
3. **Run the full test suite** and ensure all tests pass
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** with your changes
5. **Submit the PR** with a clear description

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows the style guide
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] No lint errors
- [ ] `cargo fmt`, Clippy, and Rust tests pass

---

## Style Guide

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use explicit type annotations for function parameters and returns
- Use interfaces for object shapes

### Rust

- Run `cargo fmt` and keep Clippy warning-free
- Keep protocol behavior in `native/src/converter.rs` and streaming in `native/src/stream.rs`
- Do not add a Node proxy fallback

### Naming Conventions

| Type       | Convention  | Example                |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Files      | kebab-case  | `request-converter.ts` |
| Functions  | camelCase   | `convertRequest()`     |
| Classes    | PascalCase  | `ProxyServer`          |
| Interfaces | PascalCase  | `AdapterConfig`        |
| Constants  | UPPER_SNAKE | `DEFAULT_PORT`         |

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
npm run format
```
